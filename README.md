# Easy_Python_Logs_Parsing (Devops & Cloud)

Easy_Python_Logs_Parsing is a collection of simple Python scripts designed to practice basic Python skills while solving real-world DevOps and Cloud automation problems.

This repository includes Python scripts that can handle day-to-day DevOps and Cloud log parsing tasks, such as:

Extract all IP addresses from logs.

Extract all usernames and count their frequency.

Get all failed builds from logs (Build Failed).

Find all resources mentioned in logs (azure_vm, aws_s3_bucket, k8s_pod).

Detect all lines with ERROR and save them separately.

Extract CPU and Memory usage for all VMs and convert them into integers.

Find all logs where CPU usage > 80%.

Extract container IDs (hex strings).

Count backup completions and total backup size.

Detect CrashLoopBackOff in logs and trigger an alert.


How I Practiced & Learned (Recommended for beginners)

While working on this project, I followed a step-by-step, hands-on approach to truly understand Python and its applications in DevOps and Cloud automation:

Stepwise Execution:

I ran my scripts step by step, printing outputs at every stage to see how data changes.

This helped me understand how each Python statement affects the result.

Type Checking:

I checked the type of variables and outputs at every step to ensure the data is in the expected format (e.g., strings, integers, lists).

This made debugging easier and improved my understanding of Python data structures.

Practical Scenarios:

Applied Python skills to real-world DevOps and Cloud tasks like parsing logs, extracting CPU/Memory usage, detecting errors, and identifying containers.

Simulated tasks that cloud engineers or DevOps professionals perform daily.

Iterative Learning:

Printed intermediate outputs, corrected mistakes, and refined logic for accuracy.

Repeated similar exercises for multiple scenarios to reinforce understanding.

This method helped me develop confidence in Python and understand how simple scripts can solve real-world automation problems.
