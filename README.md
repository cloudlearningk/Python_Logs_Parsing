# Easy_Python_Logs_Parsing (Devops & Cloud)

Easy_Python_Logs_Parsing is a collection of simple Python scripts designed to practice basic Python skills while solving real-world DevOps and Cloud automation problems.

This repository includes Python scripts that can handle day-to-day DevOps and Cloud log parsing tasks, such as:

Extract all IP addresses from logs.

Extract all usernames and count their frequency.

Get all failed builds from logs (Build Failed).

Find all resources mentioned in logs (azure_vm, aws_s3_bucket, k8s_pod).

Detect all lines with ERROR and save them separately.

Extract CPU and Memory usage for all VMs and convert them into integers.

Find all logs where CPU usage > 80%.

Extract container IDs (hex strings).

Count backup completions and total backup size.

Detect CrashLoopBackOff in logs and trigger an alert.


##  How I Practiced & Learned

While working on this project, I followed a **step-by-step, hands-on approach** to truly understand Python and its applications in DevOps and Cloud automation:  

1. **Stepwise Execution:**  
   - Ran scripts step by step, printing outputs at every stage to observe data changes.  
   - Helped me understand how each Python statement affects the result.  

2. **Type Checking:**  
   - Checked the **type of variables and outputs** at every step to ensure data is in the expected format (e.g., strings, integers, lists).  
   - Made debugging easier and improved my understanding of Python data structures.  

3. **Practical Scenarios:**  
   - Applied Python skills to real-world DevOps and Cloud tasks like parsing logs, extracting CPU/Memory usage, detecting errors, and identifying containers.  
   - Simulated tasks that cloud engineers or DevOps professionals perform daily.  

4. **Iterative Learning:**  
   - Printed intermediate outputs, corrected mistakes, and refined logic for accuracy.  
   - Repeated similar exercises for multiple scenarios to reinforce understanding.  

> This approach helped me **develop confidence in Python** and see how simple scripts can solve real-world automation problems.
